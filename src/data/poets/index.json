    "bio": "<p>Andro Dadiani is a poet and multimedia artist from Georgia. As Georgia is one of the most conservative countries, the artist has to work under a pseudonym and a mask for survival in communal life and freedom in art. His performances take place at different times in different countries, at exhibitions and biennales. Dadiani's poetic texts have appeared in various Georgian periodicals since 2017 and immediately attracted attention with his delicate lyrics, undisguised brutality and talking about taboo topics with natural calmness. In 2020, the author published the first collected poems: &quot;Purgatorio&quot;. The collection &quot;Purgatorio&quot; which sometimes is referred to as the first collection of homoerotic poetry in the region, was presented in 2021 with an 84-hour non-stop performance, which represented the exact time analogue of Dante Alighieri's and Virgil's journey to Purgatory. In the same year, the collection became a finalist of the &quot;New Litera&quot; literary prize, before that, due to a confrontation with the Minister of Culture, the author withdrew the collection from the competition, as the Ministry tried to intervene in the process with censorship.</p><p> In 2022, Dadiani's poems were translated for the London Poetry Week and took part in the &quot;Tbilisi International Literature Festival.&quot;</p>",
