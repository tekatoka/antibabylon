The aim of the antiBabylon 2022 project is to create a free multilingual poetic space - with a horizontal structure and an inherently international component. Essential is the comprehension of a unique linguistic identity which does not divide, but unites as well as an anti-imperialist state of mind. The project is organized by the Berlin-based international NGO PANDA platforma with the support of the German Foreign Office and takes place in cooperation with local partner organizations, such as Goethe Institut im Exil. Partner countries: Georgia, Armenia, Moldova, Ukraine and Germany This event is a part of the creative tour of the project team. During this event, the results of a 1 month multilingual poetry lab will be presented, with the selected participants and jury members from the five countries, this time with an emphasis on Georgian language. Prepare to dive into an evening full of spoken word and performance poetry flowing between languages, countries and stories.",
